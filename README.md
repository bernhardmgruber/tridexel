# Tri-dexel

This is an exemplary implementation of a tri-dexel approach for creating triangle meshes from surfaces which can be sampled using raycasting.
The implementation is intentionally kept simple and is based on:

- *Surface reconstruction from models for subtractive manufacturing simulation* by Bernhard Manfred Gruber (https://github.com/bernhardmgruber/master_thesis)
- *Feature Conservation and Conversion of Tri-dexel Volumetric Models to Polyhedral Surface Models for Product Prototyping* by Yongfu Ren, Weihang Zhu and Yuan-Shin Lee.
